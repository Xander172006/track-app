## about the project
This is a project i build for one of my most played and favourite game of 2023.
Its about the side mode in splatoon 3 called Salmon run.

Salmon run is a zombie type survival mode based on team strategizing and objectives.
The mode can get increasingly harder the higher you end up and can be played for an endless amount.


My goal was to make a tracking app to tack all of the bosses, badges and achievements that nintendo
does not give to the player in game. I spent 3 weeks on building a user interface with a dashboard that analysis the data.
In my project i also builded a self made api to track this and make relations with the database models.

the project is made with the following programming languages and frameworks:
* laravel php
* inertia js 
* react javascript
* tailwind css
* html
